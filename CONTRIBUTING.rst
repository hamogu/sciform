The current main goal for the development of ``sciform`` is
stabilization of the public user interface.
To this end, ``sciform`` is seeking feedback/suggestions about
ease-of-use for the user interface as well as naming suggestions for the
various objects and options that users interact with.
New feature request may be backlogged until the interface is stabilized,
however, new feature requests are always welcomed!
